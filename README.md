# Nonogram Mobile Adaptation

This repository was created in about half an hour, as a quick project, at the request of a friend who wanted the original site to be adapted for better display on mobile devices.  
The original project belongs to the site: [https://fedimser.github.io/nonogram.html](https://fedimser.github.io/nonogram.html).

If you also enjoy solving nonograms (Japanese crosswords) from your mobile device, you can use my adaptation, which presents the information in a slightly more modern and mobile-friendly way.

## Notes

- The original idea and logic belong to the creator of the original project.
- This is just a quick mobile-focused adaptation with minor modern UI adjustments.
